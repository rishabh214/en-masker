The project is developed in Python using Flask framework.
It provides a tool to make sure that there is continuous use of face masks by detecting masks on stream of images.
Pictures are captured from webcam at particular intervals.
The program also sends message alerts in case the user is not wearing a mask. The alert includes name of the user for identification

I developed this project keeping in mind the need to monitor cab drivers for face mask. Monitoring can be done using their mobile's camera which they always keep in front of them to use google maps. Their supervisor can be alerted if they are not using masks.
